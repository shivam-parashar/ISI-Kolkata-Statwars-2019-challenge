# ISI-Kolkata-Statwars-2019-challenge

'Shady Insurance Company' conducted a survey with a sizeable sample of random people about various things and whether he/she has an insurance or not, Inorder to model people with/without insurance. The company also hired some rookie spies to track certain people and find information about those people. The rookies sometimes failed to find out some data. Using the data available about the present set of people, the company decided to predict which set of people have an insurance, so that the agents can focus all-out on the vulnerable ones ( Ones who doesnt already have an insurance ). You are paid a hefty amount to help them in their 'borderline criminal' job.

Predict who are the ones, to most likely have an insurance and who are not.
